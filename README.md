2. The new file should only contain alphanumeric latin characters (no spaces).

1. Take a screenshot from Google Maps. `1920x680` is the current size.
2. Name the file `google-map.png`
3. Upload the image in `src/directions/images`.
4. Update `src/directions/index.js` line 67, the value of `href` should be the Google Maps link to the new location.

## landing (banner)

Two images are used as the main banner, `landing` and `poster`. `landing` is used for tablet and desktop devices (wide image, landscape, currently `2500x1308`), `poster` is used for mobile devices (narrow image, portrait, currently `845x1200`).

1. Upload new files in `src/landing/images` respectively (`landing.jpg` and `poster.jpg`)

## timetable

**Add and update stages**

1. Update `src/timetable/fixtures.js` following the format of the existing data (eg. `STAGE1`,`STAGE2`, and `STAGE3`)

Example:

```js
export const STAGE3 = {
  name: 'Stage name goes here',
  type: 'activity', // empty for music stages, "activity" for other types of stages
  displayOrder: 2, // the sort order of the stage when shown in the timetable
}
```

**Add slots**

1. Update `src/timetable/fixtures.js` following the format of the existing data.

**NOTE** When adding slots for artists or activities the value of `id` should be the same as the filename used in `src/activities/fixtures` or `src/artists/fixtures` to describe the artist (without the `.js` extension).

Example:

```js
  {
    id: 'sample-artist', // same as the filename of the artist or activity. 
    date: new Date('07/22/2018 18:00'), // month/day/year hour:minute (24hour format)
    stage: STAGE3, // the name of the stage (defined previously), no quotes
  },
```


**Gates Open & Gates Close**

1. Update `src/timetable/index.js` lines 97 & 98.
