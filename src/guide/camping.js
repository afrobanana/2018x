    <p>
      To make your festival camping experience as pleasant and comfortable as possible, ample shower and toilet facilities are available at the site. We also recommend you bring those trusty little tent pegs to pin your tents down, as it can get quite windy. For your convenience, there is a charging station and designated areas to pump inflatable mattresses – please bring your own chargers/pumps! Camping is only allowed in the allocated area within the festival site and unfortunately, finding somewhere to string up a hammock is unlikely, so we suggest you leave it at home.

      <dd>
        If festival camping in the great outdoors is your thing, you’ll first need an admission pass, and then an additional tent pass that is purchased separately. Camping passes are also limited, so get hold of yours in time to avoid disappointment. Only one camping pass per tent is required.
