      The camping area is divided into different zones to best suit your needs,
      with an allocated ‘silent zone’ for those who’d just like to sleep and
      relax. There’s also limited space for caravans to set up base and an
      accessible area reserved for disabled campers. For your convenience, there
      are designated areas to pump up your mattress and a charging station – but
      please bring your own chargers/pumps!

      <dt>CAMPSITE PASS</dt>
      <dd>
        In order to camp on the festival camping grounds, an admission pass is
        required, with an additional tent or caravan pass that must be purchased
        separately. Camping passes are limited, so be sure to get hold of yours
        in due time. Only one camping pass per tent or caravan is required.

      <dt>CAMPERS' DROP-OFF POINT</dt>
      <dd>
        For your convenience, there is an allocated campers' drop-off point near
        the festival entrance where you can drop-off your friends and camping
        gear before proceeding to the parking area. Please do not leave any of
        your belongings unattended – the festival is not responsible for any
        losses, theft or damages.

      <dt>CAMPERS' PARKING</dt>
      <dd>
        A small parking area just a few minutes’ walk from the festival site has
        been reserved for campers which will operate on a first-come
        first-served basis. The parking spot can only be accessed with a valid
        3-DAY PASS with the additional 2-NIGHT TENT PASS.
