              Why not get your friends together to make the most of the drive
              down to the festival? Sharing a ride is fun, will save you petrol
              money, it’s environmentally friendly, and it will be easier for
              everyone to park once on site!
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep an eye out for the ‘car sharing’ post on the festival’s
              Facebook and Instagram pages where you can offer or request rides.

            <h2>PARKING</h2>
            <p>
              Following the success of the festival bus last year, our lovely
              bus drivers will be ready to take you right up to the festival
              site!{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be heaps of space to park your car in a designated
              parking area that’s a three-minute drive away and a helpful team
              will be on hand to direct you there before you catch your FREE
              shuttle bus to the festival entrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              When parking your car, keep your eyes peeled for the clearly
              labelled bus stop to board the festival shuttle bus.

            <h2>SHUTTLE BUS</h2>
            <p>
              Take a fun ride with fellow festival visitors! The ABR Festival
              team will be operating a dedicated shuttle bus service between the
              parking areas and the festival entrance to make it as easy and
              hassle free as possible for you to park and then get to and from
              the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be a frequent service to ensure you don’t have to wait
              long and that your journey is quick and comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bus stops will be clearly marked at both the parking area and
              festival entrance/exit.
