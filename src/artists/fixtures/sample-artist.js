A Japanese musician with wide international acclaim, Anchorsong has become globally recognised for his unique live shows often likened to “watching a painter drawing on a white canvas.” What makes his performances special? Creating electronic music live using a sampler (MPC2500) and a keyboard, right in front of the audience! Drawing on a richly textured tapestry of outward-looking sounds, his tracks are often playlisted on BBC 6 Music and receive frequent radio airplays on major radio stations across the world. What’s more, his Ceremonial LP was ranked 5th on BBC 6 Music's ‘album of the year’ in 2016.
